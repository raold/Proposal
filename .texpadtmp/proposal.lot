\contentsline {table}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Summary comparison of differences across medicinal and dental domains. Because dental patients are usually less sick, the tablet interface needs fewer input controls. Because the number of encounters per day is lower and dental clinicians need to cover a smaller physical area, tablet devices are ideal (instead of say a smartphone). Because the number of diagnoses is small and therapies per diagnoses large, several rule-based functions could help generate treatments from problems saving time.\relax }}{11}{table.caption.5}
