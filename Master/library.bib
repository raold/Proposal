abstract = {Background. Practice-based research networks (PBRNs) are consortia of practices committed to improving clinical practice. They have become more common and include dental PBRNs. Few reports in the literature, however, have addressed the structure and function of dental PBRNs.  Methods. After initial development in Alabama, the Dental Practice-Based Research Network (DPBRN) now includes practitioner-investigators in seven U.S. states and three Scandinavian countries. Although most of the function and structure was developed at the inception of DPBRN, valuable input from practitioner-investigators has led to significant ongoing refinements.  Results. DPBRN practitioner-investigators have contributed to research at each stage of its development, leading to substantial improvements in study designs and customization of study protocols to their daily clinical practices. Practitioner-investigators also have helped refine the structure and function of DPBRN to foster the potential impact of research.  Conclusions. Practitioners from diverse settings are partnering with fellow practitioners and academics to improve daily clinical practice and meet the needs of clinicians and their patients in DPBRN.  Practice Implications. Dental PBRNs can improve clinical practice by engaging dentists in the development and implementation of studies that are of direct interest to them and their patients, and by incorporating findings from these studies into their daily clinical practice.

abstract = {Making decisions in dentistry should be based on the best evidence available. The objective of this study was to demonstrate a practical procedure and model that clinicians can use to apply the results of well-conducted studies to patient care by critically appraising the evidence with checklists and letter grade scales. To demonstrate application of this model for critically appraising the quality of research evidence, a hypothetical case involving an adult male with chronic periodontitis is used as an example. To determine the best clinical approach for this patient, a four-step, evidence-based model is demonstrated, consisting of the following: definition of a research question using the PICO format, search and selection of relevant literature, critical appraisal of identified research reports using checklists, and the application of evidence. In this model, the quality of research evidence was assessed quantitatively based on different levels of quality that are assigned letter grades of A, B, and C by evaluating the studies against the QUOROM (Quality of Reporting Meta-Analyses) and CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) checklists in a tabular format. For this hypothetical periodontics case, application of the model identified the best available evidence for clinical decision making, i.e., one randomized controlled trial and one systematic review of randomized controlled trials. Both studies showed similar answers for the research question. The use of a letter grade scale allowed an objective analysis of the quality of evidence. A checklist-driven model that assesses and applies evidence to dental practice may substantially improve dentists' decision making skill.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify and evaluate the attitudes of a cohort of fourth- and fifth-year dental students (n=53) at Griffith University in Australia to a proposed computer-based Case Study and Treatment Planning (CSTP) tool. The tool would allow students to work through the process of comprehensive, multidisciplinary treatment planning for patients in a structured and logical manner. A questionnaire was designed to investigate the students' perceived needs, attitudes, and factors deemed to be important in the design of such a tool. Students responded on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The survey was supplemented by two focus groups, one of fourth-year and one of fifth-year students. The survey results indicated strong agreement that there is a need for such a tool (fourth-year mean=6.24; fifth-year mean=5.75) and the likelihood that it would be used after hours and for extra treatment planning practice (fourth-year mean=5.82; fifth-year mean=5.45). The themes that emerged from the focus groups revealed students' agreement that a CSTP tool would be beneficial both for training and for faculty assessment of students' treatment planning skills. The type of concerns raised included whether a rigid treatment planning template might hamper the flexibility needed to deal with complex patient cases. Additionally, there was some concern that students' personal interaction with tutors would be reduced if this mode of computer-based treatment planning were to be used exclusively. In conclusion, the overall attitude of dental students was positive towards a CSTP tool. This study's findings provide guidance as to how such software could be developed and which features to include.},

abstract = {There is heightened optimism about the potential of 3D visualization software as an alternative learning resource in radiology education. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 3D visualization software on students' learning of oral radiographic interpretation from 2D radiographic images. Fourth-year dental students underwent a learning intervention phase of radiographic interpretation of oral pathoses using 3D visualization software. The success of the educational intervention was assessed by quantitative means, using a radiographic interpretation test, and by qualitative means, using a structured Likert-scale survey, asking students to evaluate their own learning outcomes. It was anticipated that training with the rotational mode of 3D visualization software would provide additional depth cues, enabling students to create spatial-mental models of anatomy that they can apply to 2D radiographic interpretation of oral pathoses. Although quantitative assessment did not support this, questionnaire evaluations demonstrated a positive effect of the 3D visualization software by enhancing students' learning about radiographic interpretation. Despite much optimism about the educational potential of 3D visualization software, it is important to understand the interactions between learners and such new technologies in order to identify potential advantages and limitations prior to embracing them as learning resources.},

@article{White2011,
abstract = {Standardized treatment procedure codes and terms are routinely used in dentistry. Utilization of a diagnostic terminology is common in medicine, but there is not a satisfactory or commonly standardized dental diagnostic terminology available at this time. Recent advances in dental informatics have provided an opportunity for inclusion of diagnostic codes and terms as part of treatment planning and documentation in the patient treatment history. This article reports the results of the use of a diagnostic coding system in a large dental school's predoctoral clinical practice. A list of diagnostic codes and terms, called Z codes, was developed by dental faculty members. The diagnostic codes and terms were implemented into an electronic health record (EHR) for use in a predoctoral dental clinic. The utilization of diagnostic terms was quantified. The validity of Z code entry was evaluated by comparing the diagnostic term entered to the procedure performed, where valid diagnosis-procedure associations were determined by consensus among three calibrated academically based dentists. A total of 115,004 dental procedures were entered into the EHR during the year sampled. Of those, 43,053 were excluded from this analysis because they represent diagnosis or other procedures unrelated to treatments. Among the 71,951 treatment procedures, 27,973 had diagnoses assigned to them with an overall utilization of 38.9 percent. Of the 147 available Z codes, ninety-three were used (63.3 percent). There were 335 unique procedures provided and 2,127 procedure/diagnosis pairs captured in the EHR. Overall, 76.7 percent of the diagnoses entered were valid. We conclude that dental diagnostic terminology can be incorporated within an electronic health record and utilized in an academic clinical environment. Challenges remain in the development of terms and implementation and ease of use that, if resolved, would improve the utilization.},

@article{Fontana2007,
abstract = {Although dentistry recognizes that dental caries management encompasses more than restoring the consequences of the disease, caries risk assessment and management that go beyond traditional restorative care have not always had a strong and organized voice during clinical curriculum development and competency assessment in U.S. dental schools. This has resulted in confusion and great variability between the need for risk-based caries management and prevention and how practitioners apply these concepts in private and community settings. Dental education is in the unique position of being able to help bridge the gap to improve dissemination of new information and to enhance communication between research and the practice of dentistry to accelerate adoption of validated approaches for the diagnosis and management of dental caries. This paper presents one example of how a dental school totally revamped its approach to teaching cariology--from a few lectures scattered throughout the curriculum to a Cariology Management Program that is integrated into all four years of the curriculum, that includes both didactic and clinical components, and that emphasizes critical thinking and problem solving. From its inception, the program was centered on a competency requirement for graduation and the principles of evidence-based practice. The process, competency, and initial programmatic outcomes assessment measures are discussed. Barriers encountered are briefly reviewed from the following perspectives: dental school structure, faculty support/calibration, students, reimbursement, and standard of care/public expectations.},

abstract = {Advances in informatics, particularly the implementation of electronic health records (EHR), in dentistry have facilitated the exchange of information. The majority of dental schools in North America use the same EHR system, providing an unprecedented opportunity to integrate these data into a repository that can be used for oral health education and research. In 2007, fourteen dental schools formed the Consortium for Oral Health-Related Informatics (COHRI). Since its inception, COHRI has established structural and operational processes, governance and bylaws, and a number of work groups organized in two divisions: one focused on research (data standardization, integration, and analysis), and one focused on education (performance evaluations, virtual standardized patients, and objective structured clinical examinations). To date, COHRI (which now includes twenty dental schools) has been successful in developing a data repository, pilot-testing data integration, and sharing EHR enhancements among the group. This consortium has collaborated on standardizing medical and dental histories, developing diagnostic terminology, and promoting the utilization of informatics in dental education. The consortium is in the process of assembling the largest oral health database ever created. This will be an invaluable resource for research and provide a foundation for evidence-based dentistry for years to come.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the importance of maintaining high quality clinical records. Evidence from studies carried out in the USA, Australia and Scandinavia shows that record keeping often falls well below accepted standards. Evidence of current standards in the UK, however, has tended to be anecdotal or circumstantial. An assessment was carried out on 47 general practitioners entering the quality assurance programme of a private capitation scheme. A sample of clinical records from each practitioner was analysed, and the presence or absence of key diagnostic and treatment planning entries were recorded. Overall, the quality of record keeping was poor, and in line with the findings of the other worldwide studies. Fundamental clinical entries that could impact on basic dental care provision were missing from many records. The frequency of recording for patients whose treatment was funded under NHS regulations was significantly worse than for patients whose treatment was privately funded.},

Time constraints that require fast data entry and maximal expression power are in favor of free text data entry. However, using patient data directly for decision support systems, for quality assessment, etc. requires structured data entry, which appears to be more tedious and time consuming. In this paper, a prototype clinical data entry application is described that combines free text and structured data entry in one single application and allows clinicians to smoothly switch between these two different input styles. A knowledge base involving a semantic network of clinical data entry terms and their properties and relationships is used by this application to support structured data entry. From structured data, sentences are generated and shown in a text processor together with the free text. This presentation metaphor allows for easy integrated presentation of structured data and free text.},

abstract = {Practice-based research networks (PBRNs) often lack sufficient funding to develop the underlying infrastructure necessary to conduct high-quality, pragmatic, policy-relevant studies. One mechanism introduced by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) that held the potential to address this issue was the PBRN Master Contract Program. The program allows the AHRQ to fund tightly focused "research activities" and to create a partnership through the PBRN contracts. Although PBRNs expected Master Contracts to strengthen them, several issues limit the utility of these contracts. The funding levels are lower than that provided from other sources for comparable work. Although some Task Order Officers are diligent, responsive, and supportive, too frequently their zeal for specific results and heavy handed approaches have led to significant "scope creep" and unrealistic expectations. Finally, a mechanism to allow PBRNs and network clinicians to influence the direction of the research questions has not been well developed. We see value in a new approach that supports the ability of the AHRQ to (1) garner support from other government agencies to engage PBRNs in studies relevant to policymakers and PBRNs; (2) capitalize on the collaborative nature of PBRNs by developing projects that support collaboration; (3) provide modest funding for infrastructure; (4) avoid the unnecessary and costly regulatory oversight from OMB; and (5) develop sustained "lines of research" on a scale, currently unavailable through the Master Contract, that can meaningfully contribute to the shaping of health policy.},

abstract = {Informed consents are important aids in helping patients make optimal decisions. Little knowledge exists about the quality of dental informed consents. Fifty-two informed consents used throughout the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Dental Branch were evaluated based on the quality of their content, readability, and presentation. Content quality was judged on four basic elements: description of procedure, risk, benefits, and alternatives. Of the clinical consents, 26 percent of forms contained all four of the basic content elements, 48 percent contained three of four elements, 16 percent contained two of four elements, and 10 percent contained one of four elements. Presentation quality was judged on twelve criteria items. The average clinical consent included seven out of twelve presentation items, and the average nonclinical consent included eight out of twelve items. Readability was judged using three standard instruments for rating readability: Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade-Level, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) grading. Average Flesch-Kincaid Grade-Level was 12.7 (range, 7.4 to 19.1), significantly higher than the recommended ninth grade level (p<.001). The results suggest that many existing dental informed consents may be improved by 1) increasing the comprehensiveness of the content, 2) improving the design and layout, and 3) reducing the readability levels for patient comprehension.},

abstract = {Clinical narratives in patient records are usually recorded in free text, limiting the use of this information for research, quality assessment, and decision support. This study focuses on the capture of clinical narratives in a structured format by supporting physicians with structured data entry (SDE). We analyzed and made explicit which requirements SDE should meet
to be acceptable for the physician on the one hand, and generate unambig- uous patient data on the other. Starting from these requirements, we found that in order to support SDE, the knowledge on which it is based needs to be '1 made explicit: we refer to this knowledge as descriptional knowledge. We articulate the nature of this knowledge, and propose a model in which it can be formally represented. The model allows the construction of specific knowledge bases, each representing the knowledge needed to support SDE within a circumscribed domain. Data entry is made possible through a gen- eral entry program, of which the behavior is determined by a combination of user input and the content of the applicable domain knowledge base. We clarify how descriptional knowledge is represented, modeled, and used for data entry to achieve SDE, which meets the proposed requirements.},

abstract = {This study assesses the feasibility of pen-based remote data entry and measures the acceptance of such systems by patients and physicians. Three clinical investigators participated in a phase-I/II clinical trial of escalated doses of chemotherapy followed by Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF). The study included 20 patients with testicular cancer who were treated at three university hospitals. The patients' data obtained in this trial were recorded and stored on a pen-based computer system. A total of 798 data points were recorded for each patient using 33 electronic forms resembling the paper forms used during an earlier phase of the study. The data recorded include the past medical history, inclusion/exclusion criteria, disease staging, therapy documentation, laboratory values and side effects. Both physicians and patients were interviewed directly after using the pen-based remote data entry system. Patients accepted that their physician was taking notes on an electronic form rather than on paper. All patients noted that a pen-based system is superior to a desktop computer when used during an interview. For the investigators electronic data entry takes additional effort, but time savings are realized later with less data clearing and increased data quality. These benefits are important for the study sponsor as well. In conclusion, pen-based remote data entry is a feasible new mode of recording clinical data with concrete benefits to both investigators and sponsors.},

Evidence from studies carried out in the USA, Australia and Scandinavia shows that record keeping often falls well below accepted standards. Evidence of current standards in the UK, however, has tended to be anecdotal or circumstantial. An assessment was carried out on 47 general practitioners entering the quality assurance programme of a private capitation scheme. A sample of clinical records from each practitioner was analysed, and the presence or absence of key diagnostic and treatment planning entries were recorded. Overall, the quality of record keeping was poor, and in line with the findings of the other worldwide studies. Fundamental clinical entries that could impact on basic dental care provision were missing from many records. The frequency of recording for patients whose treatment was funded under NHS regulations was significantly worse than for patients whose treatment was privately funded.},

abstract = {Many healthcare technology projects fail due to the lack of consideration of human issues, such as workflow, organizational change, and usability, during the design and implementation stages of a project's development process. Even when human issues are considered, the consideration is typically on designing better user interfaces. We argue that human-centered computing goes beyond a better user interface: it should include considerations of users, functions and tasks that are fundamental to human-centered computing. From this perspective, we integrated a previously developed human-centered methodology with a Project Design Lifecycle, and we applied this integration in the design of a complex distributed knowledge management system for the Biomedical Engineer (BME) domain in the Mission Control Center at NASA Johnson Space Center. We analyzed this complex system, identified its problems, generated systems requirements, and provided specifications of a replacement prototype for effective organizational memory and knowledge management. We demonstrated the value provided by our human-centered approach and described the unique properties, structures, and processes discovered using this methodology and how they contributed in the design of the prototype.},

A sixteen-item survey with a ten-point rating scale and three open-ended questions asked about students' abilities in ergonomics, confidence level, performance, preparation, and self-assessment. The surveys were administered three times to a small group of preclinical faculty members. First, faculty members (n=12, 92 percent response rate) gave their perceptions of non-VRS students' abilities at the end of their traditional course. Secondly, faculty members (n=13, 100 percent response rate) gave their expectations of the next incoming class's abilities (VRS students) prior to the start of the course with traditional and VRS components. Finally, faculty members (n=13, 100 percent response rate) gave their perceptions of VRS students' abilities after completion of the course. A Tukey's test for multiple comparisons measured significance among survey items. Faculty perceptions of VRS students' abilities were higher than for non-VRS students for most abilities examined. However, the faculty members' expectations of VRS training were higher than their perceptions of the students' abilities after VRS training for most abilities examined. Since ergonomic development and technical performance were positively impacted by VRS training, these results support the use of VRS in a preclinical dental curriculum.},

The purpose of this project was to evaluate the use of an EPR system for assessment of quality of care in an academic dental institution. The primary outcome of interest was the timeliness and completeness of restorative care following completion of nonsurgical root canal therapy. An initial query of the EPR database was performed using the following inclusion criteria: root canal treatment performed in the postgraduate endodontics clinic between September 2002 and June 2004, patient age > or =18 years old, and posterior tooth (premolars and molars). A total of 925 patients with 1,014 endodontically treated teeth met the inclusion criteria. A random sample of 30 percent of the treated teeth (302 teeth on 281 patients) was selected for detailed review. This sample of 302 teeth was then screened to determine if any restorative treatment had been performed between September 2002 and November 2005. Forty-eight percent (n=146) of the 302 teeth did not receive any form of permanent restoration over the time period studied. Twenty-five percent (n=75) of the teeth received a buildup only, and 27 percent (n=82) received the recommended treatment, a full occlusal coverage restoration. This study documents the use of an EPR system to objectively and efficiently assess one aspect of quality of care in a dental school environment.},

abstract = {Engaging busy healthcare providers in online continuing education interventions is challenging. In an Internet-delivered intervention for dental providers, we tested a series of email-delivered reminders - cues to action. The intervention included case-based education and downloadable practice tools designed to encourage providers to increase delivery of smoking cessation advice to patients. We compared the impact of email reminders focused on 1) general project announcements, 2) intervention related content (smoking cessation), and 3) unrelated content (oral cancer prevention focused content). We found that email reminders dramatically increased participation. The content of the message had little impact on the participation, but day of the week was important - messages sent at the end of the week had less impact, likely due to absence from clinic on the weekend. Email contact, such as day of week an email is sent and notice of new content post-ing, is critical to longitudinal engagement. Further research is needed to understand which messages and how frequently, will maximize participation.},

Three clinical investigators participated in a phase-I/II clinical trial of escalated doses of chemotherapy followed by Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF). The study included 20 patients with testicular cancer who were treated at three university hospitals. The patients' data obtained in this trial were recorded and stored on a pen-based computer system. A total of 798 data points were recorded for each patient using 33 electronic forms resembling the paper forms used during an earlier phase of the study. The data recorded include the past medical history, inclusion/exclusion criteria, disease staging, therapy documentation, laboratory values and side effects. Both physicians and patients were interviewed directly after using the pen-based remote data entry system. Patients accepted that their physician was taking notes on an electronic form rather than on paper. All patients noted that a pen-based system is superior to a desktop computer when used during an interview. For the investigators electronic data entry takes additional effort, but time savings are realized later with less data clearing and increased data quality. These benefits are important for the study sponsor as well. In conclusion, pen-based remote data entry is a feasible new mode of recording clinical data with concrete benefits to both investigators and sponsors.},

Through an interative design and testing approach using think-aloud sessions in the eye care setting, we were able to identify and resolve several user interface issues. Issues that we discovered and subsequently resolved included checkboxes that were too small to be selectable with a stylus, radio buttons that could not be unselcted, and font sizes that were too small to be read at arm's length.},

The purpose of this study is to report how such a system was implemented at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Dental Branch and to provide insights that may be useful for other institutions. To identify success factors and barriers, we reviewed project documents, interviewed key individuals on the implementation team, and surveyed end users before and after implementation. Eight critical issues were identified after extensive interviews with the project team. Surveys of students, faculty, and staff before and after implementation indicated that users had mixed feelings about the system in terms of efficiency and time required compared with paper charts. After using the system, many users felt that the electronic patient record improved patient care and that they would recommend such a system to dentists starting a new practice. By sharing lessons learned and knowledge about the science of implementation, we hope to reduce failures and costs for dental schools embarking on large-scale information technology implementations.},

Evidence from studies carried out in the USA, Australia and Scandinavia shows that record keeping often falls well below accepted standards. Evidence of current standards in the UK, however, has tended to be anecdotal or circumstantial. An assessment was carried out on 47 general practitioners entering the quality assurance programme of a private capitation scheme. A sample of clinical records from each practitioner was analysed, and the presence or absence of key diagnostic and treatment planning entries were recorded. Overall, the quality of record keeping was poor, and in line with the findings of the other worldwide studies. Fundamental clinical entries that could impact on basic dental care provision were missing from many records. The frequency of recording for patients whose treatment was funded under NHS regulations was significantly worse than for patients whose treatment was privately funded.},

Therefore, we assessed the degree to which two raters agree upon the presence or absence of information based on 22 popularly cited quality criteria on a sample of 21 complementary and alternative medicine websites. Our preliminary analysis showed a poor inter-rater agreement on 10 out of the 22 quality criteria. Therefore, we created operational definitions for each of the criteria, decreased the allowed choices and defined a location to look for the information. As a result 15 out of the 22 quality criteria had a kappa >0.6. We conclude that even with precise definitions some commonly used quality criteria to assess the quality of health information online cannot be reliably assessed. However, inter-rater agreement can be improved by providing precise operational definitions.},

abstract = {ObjectivePhysicians who more intensively interact with electronic health records (EHRs) through their documentation style may pay greater attention to coded fields and clinical decision support and thus may deliver higher quality care. We measured the quality of care of physicians who used three predominating EHR documentation styles: dictation, structured documentation, and free text.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of visits by patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes to the Partners Primary Care Practice Based Research Network. The main outcome measures were 15 EHR-based coronary artery disease and diabetes measures assessed 30 days after primary care visits.ResultsDuring the 9-month study period, 7000 coronary artery disease and diabetes patients made 18 569 visits to 234 primary care physicians of whom 20 (9\%) predominantly dictated their notes, 68 (29\%) predominantly used structured documentation, and 146 (62\%) predominantly typed free text notes. In multivariable modeling adjusted for clustering by patient and physician, quality of care appeared significantly worse for dictators than for physicians using the other two documentation styles on three of 15 measures (antiplatelet medication, tobacco use documentation, and diabetic eye exam); better for structured documenters for three measures (blood pressure documentation, body mass index documentation, and diabetic foot exam); and better for free text documenters on one measure (influenza vaccination). There was no measure for which dictators had higher quality of care than physicians using the other two documentation styles.ConclusionsEHR-assessed quality is necessarily documentation-dependent, but physicians who dictated their notes appeared to have worse quality of care than physicians who used structured EHR documentation.Clinical trial registration numberClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00235040.},

abstract = {Practice-based research networks have existed in medicine for many years, but they are relatively new in dentistry. Practice-based dental research is carried out in the 'real world' setting of dental practice. It encounters many problems, especially related to the clinicians' treatment decisions and their variations in assessments of clinical quality. Practice-based dental research networks have been active in Europe for the last 10-15 years and new practice-based dental research networks have recently been funded in the USA. They have been charged with the establishment of networks to carry out short-term clinical studies that have been proposed by clinicians to solve the problems they encounter in daily clinical practice. Data sharing and communication within and among the networks and with the dental community at large are a primary goal to become successful and optimally serve dental practice. A secondary goal is to conduct chart reviews on disease and treatment patterns and obtain estimates of the prevalence of less common conditions. An outline of a possible establishment of a research network is presented and the potential to institute a programme for practice-based testing of dental materials and procedures is suggested.},

abstract = {Implementation of clinical information systems is often difficult and costly. Little is known about how to implement electronic patient records in a complex dental school environment. The purpose of this study is to report how such a system was implemented at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Dental Branch and to provide insights that may be useful for other institutions. To identify success factors and barriers, we reviewed project documents, interviewed key individuals on the implementation team, and surveyed end users before and after implementation. Eight critical issues were identified after extensive interviews with the project team. Surveys of students, faculty, and staff before and after implementation indicated that users had mixed feelings about the system in terms of efficiency and time required compared with paper charts. After using the system, many users felt that the electronic patient record improved patient care and that they would recommend such a system to dentists starting a new practice. By sharing lessons learned and knowledge about the science of implementation, we hope to reduce failures and costs for dental schools embarking on large-scale information technology implementations.},

@article{Houston2010,
abstract = {Engaging busy healthcare providers in online continuing education interventions is challenging. In an Internet-delivered intervention for dental providers, we tested a series of email-delivered reminders - cues to action. The intervention included case-based education and downloadable practice tools designed to encourage providers to increase delivery of smoking cessation advice to patients. We compared the impact of email reminders focused on 1) general project announcements, 2) intervention related content (smoking cessation), and 3) unrelated content (oral cancer prevention focused content). We found that email reminders dramatically increased participation. The content of the message had little impact on the participation, but day of the week was important - messages sent at the end of the week had less impact, likely due to absence from clinic on the weekend. Email contact, such as day of week an email is sent and notice of new content post-ing, is critical to longitudinal engagement. Further research is needed to understand which messages and how frequently, will maximize participation.},

abstract = {This document was written by Task Force 3 of DentEd III, which is a European Union funded Thematic Network working under the auspices of the Association for Dental Education in Europe (ADEE). It provides a guide to assist in the harmonisation of Dental Education Quality Assurance (QA) systems across the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). There is reference to the work, thus far, of DentEd, DentEd Evolves, DentEd III and the ADEE as they strive to assist the convergence of standards in dental education; obviously QA and benchmarking has an important part to play in the European HE response to the Bologna Process. Definitions of Quality, Quality Assurance, Quality Management and Quality Improvement are given and put into the context of dental education. The possible process and framework for Quality Assurance are outlined and some basic guidelines/recommendations suggested. It is recognised that Quality Assurance in Dental Schools has to co-exist as part of established Quality Assurance systems within faculties and universities, and that Schools also may have to comply with existing local or national systems. Perhaps of greatest importance are the 14 'requirements' for the Quality Assurance of Dental Education in Europe. These, together with the document and its appendices, were unanimously supported by the ADEE at its General Assembly in 2006. As there must be more than one road to achieve a convergence or harmonisation standard, a number of appendices are made available on the ADEE website. These provide a series of 'toolkits' from which schools can 'pick and choose' to assist them in developing QA systems appropriate to their own environment. Validated contributions and examples continue to be most welcome from all members of the European dental community for inclusion at this website. It is realised that not all schools will be able to achieve all of these requirements immediately, by definition, successful harmonisation is a process that will take time. At the end of the DentEd III project, ADEE will continue to support the progress of all schools in Europe towards these aims.},

abstract = {The implementation of information technology in healthcare is a significant focus for many nations around the world. However, information technology support for clinical care, research and education in oral medicine is currently poorly developed. This situation hampers our ability to transform oral medicine into a learning healthcare discipline' in which the divide between clinical practice and research is diminished and, ultimately, eliminated. This paper reviews the needs of and requirements for information technology support of oral medicine and proposes an agenda designed to meet those needs. For oral medicine, this agenda includes analyzing and reviewing current clinical and documentation practices, working toward progressively standardizing clinical data, and helping define requirements for oral medicine systems. IT professionals can contribute by conducting baseline studies about the use of electronic systems, helping develop controlled vocabularies and ontologies,
and designing, implementing, and evaluating novel systems centered on the needs of clinicians, researchers and educators. Successfully advancing IT support for oral
medicine will require close coordination and collaboration among oral medicine professionals, information technology professionals, system vendors, and funding agencies. If current barriers and obstacles are overcome, practice and research in oral medicine stand ready to derive significant benefits from the application of information technology},

The purpose of this article is to report the development of a standardized dental diagnostic terminology by a work group of dental faculty members. The work group developed guiding principles for decision making and adhered to principles of terminology development. The members used an iterative process to develop a terminology incorporating concepts represented in the Toronto/University of California, San Francisco/Creighton University and International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 codes and periodontal and endodontic diagnoses. Domain experts were consulted to develop a final list of diagnostic terms. A structure was developed, consisting of thirteen categories, seventy-eight subcategories, and 1,158 diagnostic terms, hierarchically organized and mappable to other terminologies and ontologies. Use of this standardized diagnostic terminology will reinforce the diagnosis-treatment link and will facilitate clinical research, quality assurance, and patient communication. Future work will focus on implementation and approaches to enhance the validity and reliability of diagnostic term utilization.},

Time constraints that require fast data entry and maximal expression power are in favor of free text data entry. However, using patient data directly for decision support systems, for quality assessment, etc. requires structured data entry, which appears to be more tedious and time consuming. In this paper, a prototype clinical data entry application is described that combines free text and structured data entry in one single application and allows clinicians to smoothly switch between these two different input styles. A knowledge base involving a semantic network of clinical data entry terms and their properties and relationships is used by this application to support structured data entry. From structured data, sentences are generated and shown in a text processor together with the free text. This presentation metaphor allows for easy integrated presentation of structured data and free text.},

abstract = {This paper presents a unified framework of EHR usability, called TURF, which is (1) a theory for describing, explaining, and predicting usability differences; (2) a method for defining, evaluating, and measuring usability objectively; (3) a process for designing built-in good usability; and (4) once fully developed, a potential principle for developing EHR usability guidelines and standards. TURF defines usability as how useful, usable, and satisfying a system is for the intended users to accomplish goals in the work domain by performing certain sequences of tasks. TURF provides a set of measures for each of the useful, usable, and satisfying dimensions of usability. TURF stands for task, user, representation, and function, which are the four components that determine the usability of an EHR system. These four components are described with theoretical descriptions along with examples of how usability is measured in several case studies. How TURF can be used to improve usability through redesign is also demonstrated in a case study. In summary, this paper states that usability can not only be defined scientifically under a coherent, unified framework, it can also be measured objectively and systematically.},

abstract = {Evaluation is an important component of developing educational software. Ideally, such evaluation quantifies and qualifies the effects of a new educational intervention on the learning process and outcomes. Conducting meaningful and rigorous educational evaluation is difficult, however. Challenges include defining and measuring educational outcomes, accounting for media effects, coping with practical problems in designing studies, and asking the right research questions. Practical considerations that make the design of evaluation studies difficult include confounding, potentially small effect sizes, contamination effects, and ethics. Two distinct approaches to evaluation are objectivist and subjectivist. These two complement each other in describing the whole range of effects a new educational program can have. Objectivist demonstration studies should be preceded by measurement studies that assess the reliability and validity of the evaluation instrument(s) used. Many evaluation studies compare the performance of learners who are exposed to either the new program or a more traditional approach. However, this method is problematic because test or exam performance is often a weak indicator of competence and may fail to capture important nuances in outcomes. Subjectivist studies are more qualitative in nature and may provide insights complementary to those gained with objectivist studies. Several published examples are used in this article to illustrate different evaluation methods. Readers are encouraged to contemplate a wide range of evaluation study designs and explore increasingly complex questions when evaluating educational software.},

@article{Hand1984,
abstract = {Having recognized the differences in financial incentives between institutional providers and private practitioners participating in the Medicaid program, the New York State Health Department developed a streamlined mechanism of prior approval for 13 selected institutional providers of dental care. As part of the evaluation of this process, a retrospective audit of 316 dental records was conducted to assess the level of documentation present in the dental record. A followup audit was conducted 3 months after implementation of a plan to correct any deficiencies identified. More than 50 percent of the facilities were unable to present all the records requested at the time of the initial audit. Few of the audited records were free of deficiencies, and documentation of the results of the intra-oral examination was lacking in most facilities. The followup audit demonstrated statistically significant improvement in the level of record documentation. These results demonstrate that, even when good recordkeeping procedures were identified and agreed to by these institutional dental providers, performance was inadequate. However, the study also demonstrates that adequate records can be kept if sufficient incentives are provided. Efforts to evaluate retrospectively the delivery of dental care that are dependent on the dental record as a primary data source are unlikely to succeed unless incentives to encourage good recordkeeping are incorporated. Further research is needed to develop appropriate incentives that would operate in other practice settings.},

abstract = {Consistency in clinical decision making may be necessary for reliable assessment of student performance and teaching effectiveness, yet little has been done to examine variation in periodontal diagnosis and treatment planning among dental school faculty. The purpose of this investigation was to examine variation among faculty in diagnosis and management of common periodontal diseases. Twenty-seven clinical instructors (periodontists, general dentists, dental hygienists, and first- and second-year periodontal graduate students) reviewed three web-based cases and answered a brief questionnaire focusing on radiographic interpretation, periodontal diagnosis, and treatment planning. Response rates for the three cases ranged from 62 percent to 70 percent. Clinical instructors' rating of percent bone loss in the majority of cases varied between three descriptive categories for the same tooth. Greater consistency in periodontal diagnosis was noted within the graduate student group as compared to periodontal and dental hygiene faculty groups. Diagnoses offered for one of the three patients varied between gingivitis and chronic and aggressive periodontitis. Six to nineteen different treatment plans (many with subtle differences) were submitted for each of the three cases. Inter-rater variation was qualitatively more prevalent than intra-rater variation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document substantial variation among instructors in radiographic interpretation, diagnosis, and treatment planning for common periodontal diseases. Qualitative judgments speculating on the impact of variability among dental school faculty on student performance and patient care can be made but as yet remain unknown. Consistent use of accepted practice guidelines and greater consensus-building opportunities may decrease variation among faculty and enhance dental education.},

abstract = {Collaborative information seeking (CIS) is an intrinsic part of medical work. Patient care teams increasingly rely upon various systems, such as Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), to support collaborative information seeking across hierarchical, functional and occupational boundaries of the organization in order to enhance the quality of medical care. However, despite their proven benefits, there still are several challenges to using EMRs for CIS, in specific, and for collaborative work, in general. The objective of this research study, therefore, is to identify some of the barriers associated with using EMRs during CIS activities. We employed qualitative research methods to understand how individuals within patient care teams use EMRs during CIS and what challenges they confront in the process. We conducted this study in the Emergency Department of a 500-bed teaching hospital. We used non-participant observations and semi-structured interviews of patient care team members for collecting our data and for capturing the practices. Through our data analysis, we identified a set of barriers to using EMRs during CIS. These include a) clash of "technological frames", b) lack of collective affordances, c) fear of deviations and d) alert fatigues. From the findings of our study, we highlight implications for designing EMR systems that could augment and facilitate better CIS.},

@article{Bright2012,
abstract = {Background: Despite increasing emphasis on the role of clinical decision-support systems (CDSSs) for improving care and reducing costs, evidence to support widespread use is lacking. Purpose: To evaluate the effect of CDSSs on clinical outcomes, health care processes, workload and efficiency, patient satisfaction, cost, and provider use and implementation. Data Sources: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through January 2011. Study Selection: Investigators independently screened reports to identify randomized trials published in English of electronic CDSSs that were implemented in clinical settings; used by providers to aid decision making at the point of care; and reported clinical, health care process, workload, relationship-centered, economic, or provider use outcomes. Data Extraction: Investigators extracted data about study design, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and quality. Data Synthesis: 148 randomized, controlled trials were included. A total of 128 (86\%) assessed health care process measures, 29 (20\%) assessed clinical outcomes, and 22 (15\%) measured costs. Both commercially and locally developed CDSSs improved health care process measures related to performing preventive services (n = 25; odds ratio [OR], 1.42 [95\% CI, 1.27 to 1.58]), ordering clinical studies (n = 20; OR, 1.72 [CI, 1.47 to 2.00]), and prescribing therapies (n = 46; OR, 1.57 [CI, 1.35 to 1.82]). Few studies measured potential unintended consequences or adverse effects. Limitations: Studies were heterogeneous in interventions, populations, settings, and outcomes. Publication bias and selective reporting cannot be excluded. Conclusion: Both commercially and locally developed CDSSs are effective at improving health care process measures across diverse settings, but evidence for clinical, economic, workload, and efficiency outcomes remains sparse. This review expands knowledge in the field by demonstrating the benefits of CDSSs outside of experienced academic centers. Primary Funding Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.},

@article{Langabeer2008,
abstract = {The implementation of an electronic patient record (EPR) in many sectors of health care has been suggested to have positive relationships with both quality of care and improved pedagogy, although evaluation of actual results has been somewhat disillusioning. Evidence-based dentistry clearly suggests the need for tools and systems to improve care, and an EPR is a critical tool that has been widely proposed in recent years. In dental schools, EPR systems are increasingly being adopted, despite obstacles such as high costs, time constraints necessary for process workflow change, and overall project complexity. The increasing movement towards cost-effectiveness analyses in health and medicine suggests that the EPR should generally cover expenses, or produce total benefits greater than its combined costs, to ensure that resources are being utilized efficiently. To test the underlying economics of an EPR, we utilized a pre-post research design with a probability-based economic simulation model to analyze changes in performance and costs in one dental school. Our findings suggest that the economics are positive, but only when student fees are treated as an incremental revenue source. In addition, other performance indicators appeared to have significant changes, although most were not comprehensively measured pre-implementation, making it difficult to truly understand the performance differential-such pre-measurement of expected benefits is a key lesson learned. This article also provides recommendations for dental clinics and universities that are about to embark on this endeavor.},

abstract = {Consistency in clinical decision making may be necessary for reliable assessment of student performance and teaching effectiveness, yet little has been done to examine variation in periodontal diagnosis and treatment planning among dental school faculty. The purpose of this investigation was to examine variation among faculty in diagnosis and management of common periodontal diseases. Twenty-seven clinical instructors (periodontists, general dentists, dental hygienists, and first- and second-year periodontal graduate students) reviewed three web-based cases and answered a brief questionnaire focusing on radiographic interpretation, periodontal diagnosis, and treatment planning. Response rates for the three cases ranged from 62 percent to 70 percent. Clinical instructors' rating of percent bone loss in the majority of cases varied between three descriptive categories for the same tooth. Greater consistency in periodontal diagnosis was noted within the graduate student group as compared to periodontal and dental hygiene faculty groups. Diagnoses offered for one of the three patients varied between gingivitis and chronic and aggressive periodontitis. Six to nineteen different treatment plans (many with subtle differences) were submitted for each of the three cases. Inter-rater variation was qualitatively more prevalent than intra-rater variation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document substantial variation among instructors in radiographic interpretation, diagnosis, and treatment planning for common periodontal diseases. Qualitative judgments speculating on the impact of variability among dental school faculty on student performance and patient care can be made but as yet remain unknown. Consistent use of accepted practice guidelines and greater consensus-building opportunities may decrease variation among faculty and enhance dental education.},

Research collaborations frequently occur among participants separated by temporal, geographical, organizational, disciplinary, and cultural boundaries. Increasingly complex collaborative projects focus attention on the question of how to facilitate working together. Through so-called collaboratories, information technology can play an important role in addressing this question. A collaboratory can be defined as an information technology infrastructure that supports cooperation among individuals, groups, or organizations in pursuit of a shared goal by facilitating interaction, communication, and knowledge-sharing. Tools such as Web-based collaborative workspaces, Internet discussion lists/newsgroups/real-time chat, screen- and application-sharing, Web-based conferencing, online Web page mark-up, automatic notification, and videoconferencing can be used to implement collaboratories. Collaboratories have significant potential to facilitate cooperative research, but should be evaluated carefully to determine best practices.},

abstract = {The implementation of information technology in healthcare is a significant focus for many nations around the world. However, information technology support for clinical care, research and education in oral medicine is currently poorly developed. This situation hampers our ability to transform oral medicine into a 'learning healthcare discipline' in which the divide between clinical practice and research is diminished and, ultimately, eliminated. This paper reviews the needs of and requirements for information technology support of oral medicine and proposes an agenda designed to meet those needs. For oral medicine, this agenda includes analyzing and reviewing current clinical and documentation practices, working toward progressively standardizing clinical data, and helping define requirements for oral medicine systems. IT professionals can contribute by conducting baseline studies about the use of electronic systems, helping develop controlled vocabularies and ontologies, and designing, implementing, and evaluating novel systems centered on the needs of clinicians, researchers and educators. Successfully advancing IT support for oral medicine will require close coordination and collaboration among oral medicine professionals, information technology professionals, system vendors, and funding agencies. If current barriers and obstacles are overcome, practice and research in oral medicine stand ready to derive significant benefits from the application of information technology.},

However, their development is complex, difficult, and expensive because the Web was not developed as a programming environment. Furthermore, the technologies underlying the Web are constantly evolving, forcing developers to continuously reengineer their systems.

There is still some uncertainty, however, as to how those methods can be used to support the development process and evaluation in the most meaningful manner. In this study, we compared the results of a heuristic evaluation with those of formal user tests in order to determine which usability problems were detected by both methods. We conducted heuristic evaluation and usability testing on four major commercial dental computer-based patient records (CPRs), which together cover 80\% of the market for chairside computer systems among general dentists. Both methods yielded strong evidence that the dental CPRs have significant usability problems. An average of 50\% of empirically-determined usability problems were identified by the preceding heuristic evaluation. Some statements of heuristic violations were specific enough to precisely identify the actual usability problem that study participants encountered. Other violations were less specific, but still manifested themselves in usability problems and poor task outcomes. In this study, heuristic evaluation identified a significant portion of problems found during usability testing. While we make no assumptions about the generalizability of the results to other domains and software systems, heuristic evaluation may, under certain circumstances, be a useful tool to determine design problems early in the development cycle.},

While interest in the discipline is growing, the number of core contributors to dental informatics research remains relatively small. Two major questions for the discipline are: What are the research challenges that dental informatics faces today? and How can the discipline be strengthened and positioned to maximize its success in addressing those challenges? Progress toward research challenges formulated more than ten years ago has been varied. While many new technologies have become available for clinical dental practice, research, and education, many fundamental problems remain to be addressed with informatics research. Recommendations to augment the research capacity in dental informatics include creating a stronger worldwide dental informatics research community, drawing more biomedical informatics researchers to dental research areas, providing career opportunities for dental informatics researchers, addressing grand challenges together as a community, and recruiting subsequent generations of dental informaticians.},

The objective of this study was to develop a basic content model for clinical information in paper-based records and examine its degree of coverage by CPRs.},

abstract = {Dental informatics is a young scientific discipline that is undergoing continual maturation. Its literature is estimated to consist of approximately 600 papers published between 1975 and 2003, and it is currently growing at a rate of about 50 papers annually. While interest in the discipline is growing, the number of core contributors to dental informatics research remains relatively small. Two major questions for the discipline are: What are the research challenges that dental informatics faces today? and How can the discipline be strengthened and positioned to maximize its success in addressing those challenges? Progress toward research challenges formulated more than ten years ago has been varied. While many new technologies have become available for clinical dental practice, research, and education, many fundamental problems remain to be addressed with informatics research. Recommendations to augment the research capacity in dental informatics include creating a stronger worldwide dental informatics research community, drawing more biomedical informatics researchers to dental research areas, providing career opportunities for dental informatics researchers, addressing grand challenges together as a community, and recruiting subsequent generations of dental informaticians.},

abstract = {Non-collagenous matrix proteins secreted by the ameloblasts (amelogenin) and odontoblasts (osteocalcin) play important roles in the mineralization of enamel and dentin. In this study, comparative genomics approaches were used to identify the functional domains and model the three-dimensional structure of amelogenin and osteocalcin, respectively. Multiple sequence analysis of amelogenin in different species showed a high degree of sequence conservation at the nucleotide and protein levels. At the protein level, motifs (a sequence pattern that occurs repeatedly in a group of related proteins or genes), conserved domains, secondary structural characteristics, and functional sites of amelogenin from lower phyla were similar to those of the higher-level mammals, reflecting the high degree of sequence conservation during vertebrate evolution. Osteocalcin, produced by both odontoblasts and osetoblasts, also showed sequence similarity between species. Three-dimensional structure predictions developed by modeling of conserved domains of osteocalcin supported a role for glutamic acid residues in the calcium mineralization process.},
